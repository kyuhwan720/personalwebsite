## Introduction

I created this website because I wanted a personal online presence but wasnâ€™t sure what to build. For a while, I had an idea of incorporating an interactive 3D object into my site. Recently, after getting a job at Toss, where business cards are a common part of professional interactions, I found inspiration to design a unique digital version. I designed the business card myself using Figma and brought it to life using Three.js to create an engaging 3D experience.
